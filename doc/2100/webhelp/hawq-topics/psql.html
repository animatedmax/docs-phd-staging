      <p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> is a terminal-based front-end to HAWQ. It enables you to type in
        queries interactively, issue them to HAWQ, and see the query results. Alternatively, input
        can be from a file. In addition, it provides a number of meta-commands and various
        shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of
        tasks.</p>

          <dd class="dd pd">Specifies that <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> is to execute the specified command string, and

            command string that is completely parseable by the server, or a single backslash
            command. Thus you cannot mix SQL and <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> meta-commands with this
            option. To achieve that, you could pipe the string into <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp>, for

            the equal sign but leave off the value. These assignments are done during a very early

          <dd class="dd pd">When <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> executes a script with the <samp class="ph codeph">-f</samp> option,
            adding this option wraps <samp class="ph codeph">BEGIN/COMMIT</samp> around the script to execute it
            as a single transaction. This ensures that either all the commands complete
            successfully, or no changes are applied.</dd>

          <dd class="dd pd">If the script itself uses <samp class="ph codeph">BEGIN</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">COMMIT</samp>, or
              <samp class="ph codeph">ROLLBACK</samp>, this option will not have the desired effects. Also, if the

          Database</strong>
        <p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> is a client application for HAWQ. To connect to a database you need
          to know the following information: </p>
<ul class="ul" id="topic1__ul_ewc_q1f_qp">
          <li class="li">Name of your target database</li>

          <li class="li">Host name and port number of the HAWQ master server</li>

          <li class="li">Database user name </li>

        </ul>
<p class="p">Those parameters can be communicated to <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> via command line
          options, namely <samp class="ph codeph">-d</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">-h</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">-p</samp>, and
            <samp class="ph codeph">-U</samp>, respectively. If an argument is found that does not belong to any
          option, it is interpreted as the database name (or the user name, if the database name is
          already given).  </p>
<p class="p">Not all these options are required; there are useful defaults. If
          you omit the host name, <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> will connect via a UNIX-domain socket to a
          master server on the local host, or via TCP/IP to <samp class="ph codeph">localhost</samp> on machines
          that do not have UNIX-domain sockets. The default master port number is 5432. If you use a
          different port for the master, you must specify the port. The default database user name
          is your UNIX user name, as is the default database name. Note that you cannot just connect
          to any database under any user name. Your database administrator should have informed you
          about your access rights.</p>
<p class="p">When the defaults are not right, you can save yourself
          some typing by setting any or all of the environment variables <samp class="ph codeph">PGAPPNAME</samp>,
            <samp class="ph codeph">PGDATABASE</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">PGHOST</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">PGPORT</samp>, and
            <samp class="ph codeph">PGUSER</samp> to appropriate values. </p>
<p class="p">It is also convenient to have a
            <samp class="ph codeph">~/.pgpass</samp> file to avoid regularly having to type in passwords. This
          file should reside in your home directory and contain lines of the following
          format:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><var class="keyword varname">hostname</var>:<var class="keyword varname">port</var>:<var class="keyword varname">database</var>:<var class="keyword varname">username</var>:<var class="keyword varname">password</var></pre>
<p class="p">The

          example: <samp class="ph codeph">chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass</samp>). If the permissions are less strict than
          this, the file will be ignored. (The file permissions are not currently checked on
          Microsoft Windows clients, however.)</p>
<p class="p">If the connection could not be made for any
          reason (insufficient privileges, server is not running, etc.), <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> will
          return an error and terminate.</p>

          database to which <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> is currently connected, followed by the string
            <strong class="ph b">=&gt;</strong> for a regular user or <strong class="ph b">=#</strong> for a superuser. For
          example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">testdb=&gt;
testdb=#</pre>
<p class="p">At the prompt, the user may type
          in SQL commands. Ordinarily, input lines are sent to the server when a command-terminating
          semicolon is reached. An end of line does not terminate a command. Thus commands can be
          spread over several lines for clarity. If the command was sent and executed without error,
          the results of the command are displayed on the screen.</p>

    <div class="section" id="topic1__section10"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Meta-Commands</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Anything you enter in <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> that begins with an unquoted backslash is a
          <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> meta-command that is processed by <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> itself.
        These commands help make <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> more useful for administration or scripting.
        Meta-commands are more commonly called slash or backslash commands. </p>

      <p class="p">The format of a <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> command is the backslash, followed immediately by a
        command verb, then any arguments. The arguments are separated from the command verb and each
        other by any number of whitespace characters.</p>

      <p class="p">To include whitespace into an argument you may quote it with a single quote. To include a
        single quote into such an argument, use two single quotes. Anything contained in single
        quotes is furthermore subject to C-like substitutions for <samp class="ph codeph">\n</samp> (new line),
          <samp class="ph codeph">\t</samp> (tab), <samp class="ph codeph">\digits</samp> (octal), and <samp class="ph codeph">\xdigits</samp>
        (hexadecimal). </p>

      <p class="p">If an unquoted argument begins with a colon (<samp class="ph codeph">:</samp>), it is taken as a
          <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> variable and the value of the variable is used as the argument
        instead.</p>

      <p class="p">Arguments that are enclosed in backquotes (<samp class="ph codeph">`</samp>) are taken as a command line
        that is passed to the shell. The output of the command (with any trailing newline removed)
        is taken as the argument value. The above escape sequences also apply in backquotes. </p>

      <p class="p">Some commands take an SQL identifier (such as a table name) as argument. These arguments
        follow the syntax rules of SQL: Unquoted letters are forced to lowercase, while double
        quotes (<samp class="ph codeph">"</samp>) protect letters from case conversion and allow incorporation of
        whitespace into the identifier. Within double quotes, paired double quotes reduce to a
        single double quote in the resulting name. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">FOO"BAR"BAZ</samp> is
        interpreted as <samp class="ph codeph">fooBARbaz</samp>, and <samp class="ph codeph">"A weird"" name"</samp> becomes
          <samp class="ph codeph">A weird" name</samp>. </p>

      <p class="p">Parsing for arguments stops when another unquoted backslash occurs. This is taken as the
        beginning of a new meta-command. The special sequence <samp class="ph codeph">\\</samp> (two backslashes)
        marks the end of arguments and continues parsing SQL commands, if any. That way SQL and
          <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> commands can be freely mixed on a line. But in any case, the
        arguments of a meta-command cannot continue beyond the end of the line.</p>

      <p class="p">The following meta-commands are defined:</p>

      <dl class="dl parml">

            the previous connection will only be kept if <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> is in interactive
            mode. When executing a non-interactive script, processing will immediately stop with an
            error. This distinction was chosen as a user convenience against typos, and a safety

          <dd class="dd pd">The syntax of the command is similar to that of the SQL <samp class="ph codeph">COPY</samp> command.

                abbreviations are allowed. Unaligned writes all columns of a row on a line,
                separated by the currently active field separator. This is intended to create output
                that might be intended to be read in by other programs. Aligned mode is the
                standard, human-readable, nicely formatted text output that is default. The HTML and
                LaTeX modes put out tables that are intended to be included in documents using the
                respective mark-up language. They are not complete documents! (This might not be so
                dramatic in HTML, but in LaTeX you must have a complete document wrapper.) <p class="p">The
                  wrapped option sets the output format like the <samp class="ph codeph">aligned</samp> parameter
                  , but wraps wide data values across lines to make the output fit in the target
                  column width. The target width is set with the <samp class="ph codeph">columns</samp> option. To
                  specify the column width and select the wrapped format, use two \pset commands;
                  for example, to set the with to 72 columns and specify wrapped format, use the
                  commands <samp class="ph codeph">\pset columns 72</samp> and then <samp class="ph codeph">\pset format
                    wrapped</samp>.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Since <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> does not attempt to wrap

                  <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp> (no border), <samp class="ph codeph">1</samp> (internal dividing lines), and

                output is wide enough to require the pager. The default is <var class="keyword varname">zero</var>.
                Zero causes the target width to be controlled by the environment variable
                  <samp class="ph codeph">COLUMNS</samp>, or the detected screen width if <samp class="ph codeph">COLUMNS</samp>
                is not set. In addition, if <samp class="ph codeph">columns</samp> is zero then the wrapped format
                affects screen output only. If columns is nonzero then file and pipe output is
                wrapped to that width as well. <p class="p">After setting the target width, use the command

                results are displayed in two columns, with the column name on the left and the data
                on the right. This mode is useful if the data would not fit on the screen in the

                  wraps data from one line to the next without a newline character, a dot (.) is
                  shown in the right-hand margin of the first line, and again in the left-hand

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><samp class="ph codeph">old-ascii</samp></strong> – style

<p class="p">When the data is
                  wrapped from one line to the next without a newline character, a
                    <samp class="ph codeph">;</samp> symbol is used in place of the left-hand column
                  separator.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><samp class="ph codeph">unicode</samp></strong> – style uses Unicode box-drawing
                  characters. Newlines in data are shown using a carriage return symbol in the
                  right-hand margin. When the data is wrapped from one line to the next without a
                  newline character, an ellipsis symbol is shown in the right-hand margin of the

<p class="p">When
                  the <samp class="ph codeph">border</samp> setting is greater than zero, this option also
                  determines the characters with which the border lines are drawn. Plain ASCII
                  characters work everywhere, but Unicode characters look nicer on displays that

                output, which other programs might prefer. To set a tab as field separator, type
                  <samp class="ph codeph">\pset fieldsep '\t'</samp>. The default field separator is
                  <samp class="ph codeph">'|'</samp> (a vertical bar). </li>

<li class="li" id="topic1__kb147069"><strong class="ph b"><samp class="ph codeph">title</samp></strong> [<var class="keyword varname">text</var>] – Sets the

                The <samp class="ph codeph">\pset tuples_only</samp> command by itselt toggles between tuples only
                and full display. The values <var class="keyword varname">on</var> and <var class="keyword varname">off</var> set
                the tuples display, regardless of the current setting. Full display may show extra
                information such as column headers, titles, and various footers. In tuples only

        names; for example, <samp class="ph codeph">\dt FOO</samp> will display the table named
          <samp class="ph codeph">foo</samp>. As in SQL names, placing double quotes around a pattern stops
        folding to lower case. Should you need to include an actual double quote character in a
        pattern, write it as a pair of double quotes within a double-quote sequence; again this is
        in accord with the rules for SQL quoted identifiers. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">\dt
          "FOO""BAR"</samp> will display the table named <samp class="ph codeph">FOO"BAR</samp> (not
          <samp class="ph codeph">foo"bar</samp>). Unlike the normal rules for SQL names, you can put double
        quotes around just part of a pattern, for instance <samp class="ph codeph">\dt FOO"FOO"BAR</samp> will
        display the table named <samp class="ph codeph">fooFOObar</samp>. </p>

      <p class="p">Within a pattern, <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp> matches any sequence of characters (including no
        characters) and <samp class="ph codeph">?</samp> matches any single character. (This notation is
        comparable to UNIX shell file name patterns.) For example, <samp class="ph codeph">\dt int*</samp>
        displays all tables whose names begin with <samp class="ph codeph">int</samp>. But within double quotes,
          <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">?</samp> lose these special meanings and are just matched
        literally.</p>

      <p class="p">A pattern that contains a dot (<samp class="ph codeph">.</samp>) is interpreted as a schema name pattern
        followed by an object name pattern. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">\dt foo*.bar*</samp> displays all
        tables whose table name starts with <samp class="ph codeph">bar</samp> that are in schemas whose schema
        name starts with <samp class="ph codeph">foo</samp>. When no dot appears, then the pattern matches only
        objects that are visible in the current schema search path. Again, a dot within double
        quotes loses its special meaning and is matched literally.</p>

      <p class="p">Advanced users can use regular-expression notations. The <samp class="ph codeph">.</samp> character is
        taken as a separator. The <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp> is translated to the regular-expression
        notation <samp class="ph codeph">.*</samp>. The <samp class="ph codeph">?</samp> is translated to <samp class="ph codeph">..</samp>
        You can emulate these pattern characters at need by writing <samp class="ph codeph">?</samp> for
          <samp class="ph codeph">.,</samp><samp class="ph codeph">(R+|)</samp> for <samp class="ph codeph">R*</samp>, or
          <samp class="ph codeph">(R|)</samp> for <samp class="ph codeph">R?</samp>. Remember that the pattern must match the
        whole name, unlike the usual interpretation of regular expressions; write <samp class="ph codeph">*</samp>
        at the beginning and/or end if you don't wish the pattern to be anchored. Note that within
        double quotes, all regular expression special characters lose their special meanings and are
        matched literally. Also, the regular expression special characters are matched literally in
        operator name patterns (such as the argument of <samp class="ph codeph">\do</samp>).</p>

      <p class="p">Whenever the pattern parameter is omitted completely, the <samp class="ph codeph">\d</samp> commands
        display all objects that are visible in the current schema search path – this is equivalent
        to using the pattern <samp class="ph codeph">*.</samp> To see all objects in the database, use the pattern
          <samp class="ph codeph">*.*.</samp></p>

        <p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> provides variable substitution features similar to common UNIX
          command shells. Variables are simply name/value pairs, where the value can be any string
          of any length. To set variables, use the <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> meta-command
            <samp class="ph codeph">\set</samp>: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">testdb=&gt; \set foo bar</pre>
<p class="p">This sets
          the variable <samp class="ph codeph">foo</samp> to the value <samp class="ph codeph">bar</samp>. To retrieve the
          content of the variable, precede the name with a colon and use it as the argument of any
          slash command: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">testdb=&gt; \echo :foo
bar </pre>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The arguments
          of <samp class="ph codeph">\set</samp> are subject to the same substitution rules as with other
          commands. Thus you can construct interesting references such as <samp class="ph codeph">\set :foo
            'something'</samp> and get 'soft links' or 'variable variables' of Perl or PHP fame,
          respectively. Unfortunately, there is no way to do anything useful with these constructs.
          On the other hand, <samp class="ph codeph">\set bar :foo</samp> is a perfectly valid way to copy a
          variable.</div>
<p class="p">If you call <samp class="ph codeph">\set</samp> without a second argument, the
          variable is set, with an empty string as <var class="keyword varname">value</var>. To unset (or delete) a
          variable, use the command <samp class="ph codeph">\unset</samp>. </p>
<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp>'s internal
          variable names can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores in any order and any
          number of them. A number of these variables are treated specially by
          <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp>. They indicate certain option settings that can be changed at run
          time by altering the value of the variable or represent some state of the application.
          Although you can use these variables for any other purpose, this is not recommended, as
          the program behavior might behave unexpectedly. By convention, all specially treated
          variables consist of all upper-case letters (and possibly numbers and underscores). To
          ensure maximum compatibility in the future, avoid using such variable names for your own
          purposes. A list of all specially treated variables are as follows:</p>

            <dt class="dt pt dlterm">AUTOCOMMIT</dt>

            <dd class="dd pd">When on (the default), each SQL command is automatically committed upon successful
              completion. To postpone commit in this mode, you must enter a <samp class="ph codeph">BEGIN</samp>
              or <samp class="ph codeph">START TRANSACTION</samp> SQL command. When off or unset, SQL commands are
              not committed until you explicitly issue <samp class="ph codeph">COMMIT</samp> or
                <samp class="ph codeph">END</samp>. The autocommit-on mode works by issuing an implicit
                <samp class="ph codeph">BEGIN</samp> for you, just before any command that is not already in a
              transaction block and is not itself a <samp class="ph codeph">BEGIN</samp> or other
              transaction-control command, nor a command that cannot be executed inside a
              transaction block (such as <samp class="ph codeph">VACUUM</samp>). </dd>

            <dd class="dd pd">In autocommit-off mode, you must explicitly abandon any failed transaction by
              entering <samp class="ph codeph">ABORT</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">ROLLBACK</samp>. Also keep in mind that
              if you exit the session without committing, your work will be lost.</dd>

            <dd class="dd pd">Leavng autocommit off is closer to the SQL spec. If you prefer autocommit-off, you
              may wish to set it in your <samp class="ph codeph">~/.psqlrc</samp> file.</dd>

              display. Therefore only a limited amount of memory is used, regardless of the size of
              the result set. Settings of 100 to 1000 are commonly used when enabling this feature.

</div><div class="sectiondiv"><strong class="ph b">SQL Interpolation</strong>
        <p class="p">An additional useful feature of <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> variables is that you can
          substitute (interpolate) them into regular SQL statements. The syntax for this is again to
          prepend the variable name with a colon (<samp class="ph codeph">:</samp>).
          </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">testdb=&gt; \set foo 'my_table'
testdb=&gt; SELECT * FROM :foo; </pre>
<p class="p">Variables
          can even contain unbalanced quotes or backslash commands. You must make sure that it makes
          sense where you put it. Variable interpolation will not be performed into quoted SQL
          entities. </p>
<p class="p">A popular application of this facility is to refer to the last inserted
          OID in subsequent statements to build a foreign key scenario. Another possible use of this
          mechanism is to copy the contents of a file into a table column. First load the file into
          a variable and then proceed as above.
          </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">testdb=&gt; \set content '''' `cat my_file.txt` ''''
testdb=&gt; INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (:content); </pre>
<p class="p">One
          problem with this approach is that <samp class="ph codeph">my_file.txt</samp> might contain single
          quotes. These need to be escaped so that they don't cause a syntax error when the second
          line is processed. This could be done with the program <samp class="ph codeph">sed</samp>:
          </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">testdb=&gt; \set content '''' `sed -e "s/'/''/g" &lt; my_file.txt` 
'''' </pre>
<p class="p">Note
          the use of different shell quoting conventions so that neither the single quote marks nor
          the backslashes are special to the shell. Backslashes are still special to
            <samp class="ph codeph">sed</samp>, however, so we need to double them. </p>
<p class="p">Since colons may
          legally appear in SQL commands, the following rule applies: the character sequence
            <samp class="ph codeph">":name"</samp> is not changed unless <samp class="ph codeph">"name"</samp> is the name of a
          variable that is currently set. In any case you can escape a colon with a backslash to
          protect it from substitution. (The colon syntax for variables is standard SQL for embedded
          query languages, such as ECPG. The colon syntax for array slices and type casts are HAWQ
          extensions, hence the conflict.) </p>
</div><div class="sectiondiv"><strong class="ph b">Prompting</strong>
        <p class="p">The prompts <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> issues can be customized to your preference. The three

          contain strings and special escape sequences that describe the appearance of the prompt.
          Prompt 1 is the normal prompt that is issued when <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> requests a new
          command. Prompt 2 is issued when more input is expected during command input because the

        <p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> supports the NetBSD libedit library for convenient line editing and

          although the completion logic makes no claim to be an SQL parser. If for some reason you
          do not like the tab completion, you can turn it off by putting this in a file named

      <p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> is built as a console application. Since the Windows console windows
        use a different encoding than the rest of the system, you must take special care when using
        8-bit characters within <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp>. If <samp class="ph codeph">psql</samp> detects a
        problematic console code page, it will warn you at startup. To change the console code page,
        two things are necessary: </p>

      <div class="p">Set the code page by
          entering:<pre class="pre codeblock">cmd.exe /c chcp 1252</pre>
<samp class="ph codeph">1252</samp> is a character
        encoding of the Latin alphabet, used by Microsoft Windows for English and some other Western
        languages. If you are using Cygwin, you can put this command in
          <samp class="ph codeph">/etc/profile</samp>. </div>

      <p class="p">Set the console font to Lucida Console, because the raster font does not work with the ANSI
        code page.</p>
